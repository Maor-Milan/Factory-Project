# Factory-Project
factory managment project based on:JS,ASP.NET and MSSQL

In the front end we have a vanilla JavaScript,html and basic css,also in the front end we have basic bootstrap to make it look a little bit prettier.
All the function who runs the program are located in the "Functionalty.js".
The front is a basic website with navigation and data transfering from page to page.
In addition the front needs to communicate between the pages and update the server with the information.
