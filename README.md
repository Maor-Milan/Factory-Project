factory managment project based on:JS,ASP.NET and MSSQL

In the front end we have a vanilla JavaScript,html and basic css,also in the front end we have basic bootstrap to make it look a little bit prettier.
All the function who runs the program are located in the "Functionalty.js".
The front is a basic website with navigation and data transfering from page to page.
In addition the front needs to communicate between the pages and update the server with the information.


# Factory-Project
## Description  
Welcome to my first JavaScript project.  
With this app as a admin yoc can simply manage employees,shifts and info like departments.  

## Project Description
This project is my first attempt to do a full scale fullstack app.  
It was a challanging experience to handle all the strings between the front pages and the back end while monitoring the DB is well updated.  
My struggles with this project was to navigate with data between pages but like most code problams i succeeded to overcome the problams and complete the app.  


## Technologies
1.The front end is based on vanilla JS and contains html pages using basic css and bootstrap for the eye candy.
2.The back end is made with ASP.NET with C# using "Entity Framework" who converts SQL table to classes.  
The back end use CRUD operation stracture with a link to MSSQL.  
3.The data base is MSSQL.
